        <p>You know the words. Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, the story of a young man from West Philadelphia sent to live
            with his aunt and uncle in an upscale Los Angeles neighborhood, is classic 90s sitcom. The format’s
            familiar, the plots predictable, and yet there’s something special about this cast and characters that
            made Fresh Prince stand the test of time. Of course the pure charisma of Will Smith didn’t hurt either, and
            it’s no surprise that the show ended just as Smith’s movie career was taking off. But the dichotomy of
            seeing this street-smart teenager clash with the upper class lifestyle of his extended family made for some
            swell comedy, and plenty of touching moments too. </p>
