        <p>One of the longest running series of the 90s, this fantastic sitcom that centered on the Winslow family (and
            on their infamously nerdy neighbor) actually started as a spin-off series from Perfect Strangers. That show
            introduced elevator operator Harriette Winslow (played by Jo Marie Payton) and her cop husband Carl
            (Reginald VelJohnson), but it was Family Matters that brought families across the country into the Winslows’
            living room. The middle-class African-American family living in Chicago dealt with both the mundane –
            domestic disagreements, problems at school, irksome neighbors – and the topical – racial issues, gun
            violence, drug use – and they did it with heart and humor.
            But it was the introduction of the irritating, invention-minded nerdy neighbor Steve Urkel (Jaleel White)
            that caused the show to skyrocket in the ratings halfway through the show’s first season. The power of Urkel
            was so strong that when the youngest Winslow daughter, Judy, disappeared (ie, she was written out of the
            show) in the fourth season, no explanation was offered up. It didn’t matter; America was infatuated with
            Steve Urkel, his suave alter-ego Stefan Urquelle, and yeah even cousin Myrtle. Who could forget Urkel’s
            jetpack rope-climbing solution, or his dual proposal to Laura at Disney World, or that god-awful
            catchphrase? I won’t say it; I know you can hear it in your head already. </p>
