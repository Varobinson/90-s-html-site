        <p>Let’s forget for a moment how many spinoffs and imitators this towering bastion of TV has produced over the
            years — proving its popularity and also its legacy — and remember just how fantastic the basis of this show
            really is. Has any procedural nailed the format so perfectly? There’s a reason Law & Order is still in
            syndication on a number of networks — you can tune in at any time, to any episode, and get sucked in to a
            story. The “ripped from the headlines” plots also gave the show a platform to deal with some very difficult
            real-world issues, mostly on the law side, but occasionally regarding the police as well.
            Though we never got to know the investigators or attorneys very well, they were all essential to the story
            being told (if you love Law & Order, you absolutely have your favorite cast lineups). That unforgettable
            interstitial “chung-chung” will be lodged in our collective minds forever, and though NBC dropped the ball
            with the series in its final seasons and let it wither on the vine, the original will always be the best.
