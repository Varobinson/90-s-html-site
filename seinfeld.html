        <p>Seinfeld is one of the greatest TV shows of all time. Full-stop. Along with Friends, it stands as the iconic
            sitcom of the 90s, but it wasn’t just a success in the realm of comedy—it was a success in the television
            medium as a whole. The central conceit of Seinfeld is to follow the lives of four individuals, but there are
            two main twists. 1. Their lives will be as normal and uneventful (in the television sense) as possible. And
            2. These will not be great people. It turns out it’s a match made in heaven. 
            Contrary to what many may say, Seinfeld isn’t a show about nothing. It’s a show about what happens when you
            do and say the things you’re not supposed to do and say. Jerry, Elaine, George, and Kramer are constantly
            going against the grain of social norms, which serves as both the basis and the premise of the comedy that
            ensues. It’s a brilliantly simple twist on the sitcom format, and it allowed four incredible performers to
            shine week after week. And while the stories got a little too outlandish following Larry David’s exit, the
            series remained watchable due to the chemistry and charisma of Jerry Seinfeld, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Jason
            Alexander, and Michael Richards.
            Episodes like “The Contest” and “The Chinese Restaurant” are classics not because of some crazy plot
            development or thrilling twist—they stand out because the dialogue-driven narrative unfurls in an
            unforgettable manner, and because these performers land beat after beat with impeccable comedic timing.
            Television has changed dramatically since Seinfeld left the airwaves, but this show will never not be funny,
            relatable, and just a smidge despicable. </p>
